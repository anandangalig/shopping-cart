# Anand Angalig's Product Developer Assignment

I mostly focused on getting the business logic done. Did not spend too much time styling the components.
If I had more time, I would have polished up the styles, make it mobile-friendly, and perhaps add the search capability to add new items to the cart.

**Technologies used:**

- I used React for the UI because I feel most comfortable with it.
- Used Axios for HTTP requests because of its' easy-to-use methods.

**To run it locally:**

1. Clone repo
2. `yarn` to install dependencies
3. `yarn start` to start the project
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/
